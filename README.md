# 🏦 Loan Approval & Loan Amount Prediction App

An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts:

✅ Loan Approval (Yes/No)
✅ Eligible Loan Amount (₹)

# Built using a two-stage ML pipeline and deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application.

📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world bank loan decision system using Machine Learning.
It uses a two-stage prediction approach:

🔹 Stage 1 — Loan Approval (Classification)

Predicts whether a loan should be approved or rejected.

🔹 Stage 2 — Loan Amount (Regression)

If approved, it predicts the eligible loan amount for the applicant.
This mirrors how financial institutions often separate risk assessment and amount eligibility.

# 🧠 ML Workflow
# 1️⃣ Data Processing

Cleaned and standardized dataset
Handled categorical & numerical features
Removed ID columns and irrelevant fields
Managed missing values

# 2️⃣ Feature Engineering
Column stripping & formatting
Target encoding for loan status
Separation of categorical & numerical pipelines

# 3️⃣ Preprocessing Pipelines
Numerical:
Median imputation
Standard scaling

Categorical:
Most-frequent imputation
One-Hot Encoding

# 4️⃣ Model Training

Two independent pipelines:
# ✅ Classification Model
RandomForestClassifier
Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
Stratified train-test split
F1-score optimization

Performance:
Accuracy ≈ 98%
F1 Score ≈ 0.98 

# 💰 Regression Model

RandomForestRegressor
GridSearchCV tuning
R² optimization

Performance:
R² Score ≈ 0.87
RMSE ≈ 3.27M
